- I’m a Business Systems Analyst for a large IT services company.  Some teams in my company have begun using GitHub for CI/CD, and I'm trying to set up deployment pipelines for my team (I would have a dev from organization help, but it's a resource issue - isn't it always).  
- I'm studying for my Github Foundations exam, and have been experimenting with some basic workflows on my company's GitHub account, but have been unable to find a workflow which does what I'm looking for - a pipeline which can deploy the latest version of an SSRS .rdl to an SSRS/Power BI server.
- I’m looking for help with designing a pipeline which can take 2 inputs - file name and deployment environment (Dev,Test,Staging, Production) and deploy the latest version of the .RDL file or Project file to an SQL Services Reporting Server (SSRS).
